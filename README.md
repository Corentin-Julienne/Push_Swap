# Push_Swap

## 🗣️ About

Push_Swap is a project of School 42 which is about sorting algorithm.

the goal will be to sort a stack of unsorted numbers with the fewest possible operations. 


Note that we need to sort the numbers with a minimal number of operations, not in a minimal time. So the program we provided is quite eficient regarding the requirement. However, it is very slow.

The program will trigger an error message in those following cases :

-> numbers are already sorted <br>
-> some arguments are not numbers <br>
-> some numbers are duplicated <br>

More information can be found on the subject PDF.

## 💿 Compilation and Execution

A Makefile is provided with this program. Just write ```make``` to create object files and an executable. 

To execute the program, wite ```./push_swap <numbers>```. You better use an online random number generator such this one : https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/random-number-generator.php.

## 🗑️ Deletion

The Makefile also handles deletion. Just write ```make fclean``` to remove object files and executable and ```make clean```to remove only the object files.

## ✅ Validation

This project has been validated with a mark of 86/100.
